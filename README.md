## 💡 Key Insights

> "Every bug is a teacher. Every successful compilation is a victory. Every algorithm mastered is a step closer to my dreams."

1. **Read the problem 3 times** before coding
2. **Think about edge cases** from the start
3. **Test early and often** - don't wait for perfect code
4. **Document your thought process** for future reference

##  Future Goals

- [ ] Complete all Piscine exam levels (0-5)
- [ ] Build a portfolio of clean, efficient solutions
- [ ] Master advanced C programming concepts
- [ ] Successfully pass the actual Piscine
- [ ] Secure my place at 42 School
